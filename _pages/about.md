Greatings! I am currently pursuing my PhD degree at the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MIL)](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) under the supervision of Prof. [Tatsuya Harada](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/harada). Before that, I obtained my Master’s degree from the [Intelligent Systems and Informatics (ISI) Laboratory](https://www.isi.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp) at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, where I was supervised by Prof. [Kohei Nakajima](https://www.kohei-nakajima.com) and Prof. [Yasuo Kuniyoshi](https://www.isi.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/member). I received my Bachelor degree of Engineering in University of Waterloo, ON, Canada.

My research interests are centered around 3D Computer Vision, Robotics, and Computational Photography. Currently, my work focuses on integrating physical priors into 3D world modeling to bridge the gap between data-driven and physics-based learning methodologies.
